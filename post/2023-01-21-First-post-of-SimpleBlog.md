# First post of SimpleBlog

I am tired of building, maintaining a blog, finding pictures, and other things. Most of my time is spent on these tasks rather than writing articles. So I started a simple blog that only stores the content of my articles.

The main content of the blog will be related to programming. My native language is not English, so there may be grammar errors and straightforward and uncomplicated descriptions. Content related to programming will be in English as much as possible, and content related to life will be in traditional Chinese.
