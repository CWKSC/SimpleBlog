# First post of SimpleBlog

I am tired of building, maintaining a blog, finding pictures, and other things. Most of my time is spent on these tasks rather than writing articles. So I started a simple blog that only stores the content of my articles.

The blog is mainly related to programming. My native language is not English, so there will be grammar errors and straightforward and uncomplicated descriptions.
